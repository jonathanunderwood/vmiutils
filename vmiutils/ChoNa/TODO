- Replace all of the plreg stuff - use the projected landweber module
  instead

- Remove unused blurring stuff

- Wrap these methods up into an object, which possibly subclasses
  CartesianImage

- Move plotting stuff into the above object and out of cnfit. Model it
  on the pbasex plotting objects.

- Add capability for calculaing expectation values of <cos^n theta> to
  PolarImage - calculate from fitted beta values

- Clean up cnfit a lot! Notably add an out put file argument rather
  than dumping to junk.pdf!
